# CSCI 4052u Project Proposal

## Project Idea
Analyze photos to detect objects within the photos and provide a detailed description, as well as answering questions about the photo.

## Purpose
To help the visually impaired by providing a text description (that could be read out) of what the scene looks like. I imagine this (if executed well) could be used in smart glasses or a similar device to help the visually impaired understanding their surroundings.

## Elements

### Vision
Analyzing the uploaded photo

### Natural Language
Describing the photo in words and potentially answering follow-up questions

### Reinforcement Learning (if time permits)
Potentially try and find a safe path to walk... for example when approaching a crosswalk this would be able to guide the user to not accidentally enter the road.

## Encoding the Domain and Range

### TODO: Describe how you plan to encode the domain and range of the task as vectors, matrices and tensors.

## Data Collection

### TODO: Survey sources of data collection
